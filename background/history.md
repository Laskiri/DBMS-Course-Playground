# History of Database Systems

## 1950s and early 1960s
- Data processing using magnetic tapes for storage.
- Tapes provided only sequential access.
- Punched cards were used for input.

## Late 1960s and 1970s
- Hard disks allowed direct access to data.
- Network and hierarchical data models were in widespread use.
- Ted Codd defined the relational data model, which became a foundational concept in database systems.
- Ted Codd won the ACM Turing Award for his work on the relational data model.

## 1980s
- Research relational prototypes evolved into commercial systems.
- SQL (Structured Query Language) became the industrial standard for database management.
- Development of parallel and distributed database systems by organizations such as Wisconsin, IBM, and Teradata.
- Emergence of object-oriented database systems.

## 1990s
- Development of large decision support and data-mining applications.
- Creation of large multi-terabyte data warehouses.
- Emergence of Web commerce, which drove the need for more advanced database systems.

## 2000s
- Introduction of big data storage systems such as Google BigTable, Yahoo PNuts, and Amazon's storage solutions.
- Rise of "NoSQL" systems designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data.
- Development of big data analysis tools that went beyond traditional SQL, including MapReduce and similar technologies.

## 2010s
- Revival of SQL with new capabilities, often referred to as "SQL reloaded."
- Integration of SQL front ends with MapReduce systems.
- Development of massively parallel database systems.
- Introduction of multi-core main-memory databases, which significantly improved performance for certain types of applications.
