# Relational Model

## Motivation

The relational model is fundamental to understanding SQL and database systems. Here are the key motivations:

- **SQL's Data Model Resembles the Relational Model**: SQL, the standard language for querying databases, is heavily influenced by the relational model. Understanding the relational model helps in comprehending SQL's structure and behavior.
- **SQL is Partly Based on Relational Algebra**: Relational algebra forms the theoretical foundation of SQL. It provides a set of operations for manipulating relations (tables) that SQL implements.
- **Relational Algebra Helps Understanding Query Plans and Query Optimization**: Knowledge of relational algebra is crucial for understanding how queries are executed and optimized by the database engine. It aids in writing efficient queries and troubleshooting performance issues.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

- **Explain the Relational Model**: Understand the basic concepts of the relational model, including relations (tables), attributes (columns), and tuples (rows).
- **Create Non-Trivial Relational Algebra Queries**: Formulate complex queries using relational algebra operations such as selection, projection, union, set difference, Cartesian product, and renaming.
- **Use the Various Join Types in Relational Algebra Queries**: Apply different types of joins (inner join, outer join, natural join, etc.) in relational algebra to combine data from multiple relations.
