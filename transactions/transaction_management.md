# Transaction Management in a Database Management System (DBMS)

Transaction management in a Database Management System (DBMS) refers to the process of managing a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction is a group of one or more SQL statements that are executed together, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Transaction management ensures that these operations are completed successfully and that the database remains in a consistent state, even in the presence of failures.

## Key Concepts of Transaction Management

### ACID Properties:

- **Atomicity:** Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is left unchanged.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that a transaction takes the database from one consistent state to another. The database must remain consistent before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation:** Ensures that the operations within a transaction are isolated from other transactions. This prevents concurrent transactions from interfering with each other.
- **Durability:** Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures.

### Transaction States:

- **Active:** The transaction is currently being executed.
- **Partially Committed:** The transaction has completed its final operation but has not yet been committed.
- **Committed:** The transaction has been successfully completed, and its changes are now permanent.
- **Failed:** The transaction has encountered an error, and its operations cannot be completed.
- **Aborted:** The transaction has been rolled back, and the database is restored to its previous state.

### Transaction Control Commands:

- **BEGIN:** Starts a new transaction.
- **COMMIT:** Saves all changes made during the transaction and makes them permanent.
- **ROLLBACK:** Undoes all changes made during the transaction and restores the database to its previous state.
- **SAVEPOINT:** Sets a savepoint within a transaction, allowing partial rollback to that point.

## Conclusion

Transaction management is crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency in a DBMS. It ensures that a sequence of operations is executed as a single unit, adhering to the ACID properties. By using transaction control commands and handling transactions properly, you can ensure that your database remains consistent and reliable, even in the presence of errors or failures.
