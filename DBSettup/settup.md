# Database Setup Instructions

You can use the SQL files in this folder to quickly set up the schema for a new database and populate it with data.

## Steps

1. **Create Tables**: Query the DDL SQL script on your new database to create tables.
2. **Populate Data**: Query either of the other scripts to populate data.

## Additional Information

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute SQL scripts on the database.
- Verify the database connection settings before running the scripts.
- Backup your database if you are running these scripts on an existing database to avoid data loss.
